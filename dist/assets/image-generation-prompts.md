# Image generation prompts for BrightPlanner recipes

Instructions

- Use the prompt blocks below with your chosen generator (DALL·E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion). Each block includes: a photo/art prompt, suggested negative prompts, 2–3 style variants, an aspect ratio suggestion, and a reproducible seed.
- To keep final files <200 KB: generate at 1024×1024 (or 800×800) then convert to JPEG or WebP and compress to target. Example using ImageMagick to compress to under 200 KB is provided at the end.
- Prioritize photorealistic food images, natural lighting, simple plates/props, and top-down or 45° angle where suggested.

Global negative prompt (use with generators that support it):

- "text, watermark, logo, signature, extra fingers, out of frame, ugly, deformed, lowres, cartoon, anime"

Example: OpenAI / DALL·E style request (replace with your provider's API parameters):

- JSON body idea:

```
{
  "prompt": "<use the prompt above>",
  "n": 1,
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "response_format": "b64_json",
  "seed": 1001
}
```

Example: AUTOMATIC1111 / Stable Diffusion WebUI curl (local):

```
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7860/sdapi/v1/txt2img" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "prompt": "<use the prompt above>",
  "negative_prompt": "text, watermark, logo, signature",
  "sampler_index": "Euler a",
  "seed": 1001,
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024,
  "steps": 20,
  "cfg_scale": 7.0
}'
```

Midjourney style: paste the prompt in chat with modifiers, e.g.:

- "<prompt> --ar 4:3 --v 6 --q 2 --seed 1001"

Post-processing to get <200 KB (ImageMagick):

- Resize and compress to 900×900 and JPEG quality 78 (should produce <200 KB for most images):

```powershell
magick input.png -resize 900x900 -strip -quality 78 -define jpeg:extent=200KB output.jpg
```

- Or convert to WebP which usually compresses better:

```powershell
magick input.png -resize 900x900 -strip -quality 80 output.webp
```

Notes & tips

- If you need strict Bright Line compliance visuals, emphasize "no added sugar, no bread/refined grains" in the prompt and show cauliflower rice or lettuce wraps as substitutes.
- For consistent site aesthetic, use the same aspect ratio and similar background across the set (e.g., neutral slate or white) and keep lighting consistent.
- Seeds provided are suggestions to reproduce variants; adjust if your generator uses different seed semantics.

If you'd like, I can:

- Split these into one prompt file per image in `public/assets/` (one `.txt` per image) for direct copying to generators.
- Generate smaller preview JPGs using programmatic rendering (SVG → JPEG/WebP) here and add them to the repo (limited to simple illustrations). I cannot run external image APIs from here.
